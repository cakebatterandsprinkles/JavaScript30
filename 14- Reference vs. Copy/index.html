    // Strings, numbers and booleans directly are directly copied from one variable to another
    // Even of you change the original one, the copied one will keep it's initial value that is assigned to it.
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // 'Wes', 'Wes'
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); // 'wesley', 'Wes'

    // Array and objects create reference copies, they still refer to the same common array.
    // So if you change something in the copied / original array, it will change for the other one as well.
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const playersCopy1 = players.slice(); // will return a real copy of the original array, not just a pointer.

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const playersCopy2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the ES6 Spread Operator
    const playerCopy3 = [...players];

    // or use Array.from
    const playerCopy4 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    const person = {
      name: 'Cookie Birdie',
      age: 2
    };

    // one way, Object.assign(obj, copiedObj, anyOtherParameters);
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
      number: 99
    });
    console.log(person); // {name: 'Cookie Birdie', age: 2}
    console.log(person2); // {name: 'Cookie Birdie', age: 2, number: 99}

    // another way, object ...spread  
    const person3 = {
      ...person
    };

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 
    // makes shallow copies, still keeps references of the objects/arrays inside the main object
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    // another cheat to make deep copies is stringifying the object and then immediately parsing it: (poor man's deep clone)
    const person4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    // so here, even if we have arrays / objects as properties for the main object, they will be deepcloned.
